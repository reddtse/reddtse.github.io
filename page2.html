                <blockquote><p><strong>Langoy Para sa Kaluwasan:</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The Langoy Para Sa Kaluwasan project has brought valuable knowledge and skills regarding swimming, water safety, and disaster preparedness to the children and youth of Ormoc City. These skills are vital for all, but especially in the Philippines, since many Filipinos live in coastal areas, rely on the ocean for food and livelihood, and travel by boat. However, in this archipelago of over 7,000 islands, very few Filipinos know how to swim. Reasons for this include fear of the water and storms, unclean water, and socioeconomic barriers to formal swimming lessons. Translated from Cebuano, this project title means “Swim for Safety,” but the word kaluwasan also hints at freedom and liberty, showing how this project has enabled the community to view the ocean as a source of opportunity, rather than as a danger. Swimming skills are also important to those who do not live on the coast, but rather in flood-prone areas or areas with fishponds or rivers. Children can drown in as little as one inch of water, making these skills applicable to everyone. Swimming is a fun and enjoyable life skill that is part of a healthy lifestyle. This project started a dialogue in the community regarding the importance of knowing how to swim and proper water safety techniques. It aims to create a culture where these skills are valued and taught from a young age.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">As climate change continues to wreak havoc, risks of flooding and storms increase. In 1991, Ormoc was affected by a flash flood which killed 8,000 people and irrevocably changed the landscape of the city, both physically and psychologically. By training participants in disaster preparedness as well, this project addressed micro and macro levels of these issues by providing concrete skills and knowledge to ensure that youth are capacitated, educated, and able to make a difference in the community. In order to do this, Hayag Youth Organization, in partnership with Hayag Family Development Center, working with ChildFund International, hosted a Swim Camp, Disaster Preparedness Training, and Open Water Safety Training in Summer 2013 for indigent children and youth in Ormoc City.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">This project required cooperation and linkages with many area organizations that shared their expertise. The students and instructors from the Institute of Human Kinetics at Visayas State University exemplified the spirit of volunteerism as they taught the participants how to swim and execute water safety and rescue techniques. The Ormoc City Disaster Risk Management Office provided training on disaster preparedness, and the Ormoc City RESCUE Team provided Basic First Aid and CPR training. The Ormoc City Coast Guard served as lifeguards and rescue personnel during the Open Water Safety Training. United States Peace Corps Volunteers joined the trainings to serve as support staff and lifeguards, and to give the participants the opportunity to engage in cross-cultural dialogue and activities. The Langoy Para Sa Kaluwasan project has made a concrete and valuable difference in the lives of children and youth in Ormoc.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">This project was a result of many community conversations after a boat accident in October 2011. Hayag Youth Organization had organized a mangrove planting in a coastal area in Ormoc City, and participants were using small wooden bangka boats to traverse the area. On the way back to shore, an overloaded boat full of youth capsized. Thankfully, the water was shallow and participants were able to wade back to shore with only minor injuries and the loss of some phones and electronics. However, some of the Peace Corps Volunteers serving in the area who had been present at the event began to spark community conversation when they wondered what would have happened had the water been even a foot higher, or if the accident had taken place during high tide. It turned out that none of the youth in the boat knew how to swim, which was shocking to the American Volunteers, who had been taught to swim from a young age, as is customary in the US. Observations showed that very few Filipinos knew how to swim, that boats often did not have enough lifejackets for passengers, and that water safety and disaster preparedness skills were not being taught in schools. It took a year and a half of community dialogue and work with community organizations before the Langoy Para Sa Kaluwasan project was organized, but this allowed for the project to develop holistically, with full support from the community, and enthusiastic commitment from the participants.</span></p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p><strong>Who are the beneficiaries and how did they benefit?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.09rem;">52 children and youth participated in the 3-day swim camp and disaster management training. 37 children and youth, most of whom had joined the camp, participated in the follow up 1-day open water safety training. These participants hailed from ten of the poorest barangays in Ormoc, many of which are coastal fisherfolk barangays. They ranged in age from 10 to 24 and many of them are children and youth in difficult circumstances, such as poverty, family problems, and unable to continue schooling. Each benefited from the various trainings as they were taught how to swim, what to do before, during, and after a disaster, and how to safely engage in open water as a swimmer, fisher, or passenger on a boat. Monitoring and evaluation shows that every single participant significantly improved his/her swimming skills. The participants, especially the youth leaders, are now able to serve as front-liners in their community on these issues, and to build their leadership skills.  They also benefited from engagement with positive role models from Visayas State University, the Ormoc City Disaster Risk Management Office, the Ormoc City RESCUE Team, the Coast Guard, and US Peace Corps Volunteers. Being exposed to these diverse and successful people was a great opportunity for participants to learn more about their community’s resources, about possible college and career tracks, and to engage in cross-cultural exchange with Americans. They also had the opportunity to relax, have fun, build bonds with their peers, and truly enjoy a summer vacation.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.09rem;">This project relied on of financial, in-kind, and community resources to be successful and to give the community a sense of ownership. We applied for a grant through the Peace Corps Partnership Program, a unique funding opportunity which allowed for the program to be posted online and for donors all over the world to contribute. We raised PhP 61,214.50 through this program. Our donors ranged from American Girl Scout troops to Manila businessmen, showing how this need resonated with many people of different backgrounds. Part of our success in this endeavor was due to a video we created and posted on YouTube and Facebook, which allowed donors to have a visual view of the impact of their money. (View the video here: http://goo.gl/UVmzK) Hayag Family Development Center counterparted PhP 29,992 for this program, both in financial contributions and in-kind donations, such as venue use. Our community resources were the generous services (swim teachers, presentations, etc.) and materials (lifejackets, first aid materials, etc.) provided by area groups, such as VSU, the city Disaster Risk Management Council, the RESCUE Team, and the Coast Guard, none of which would accept financial compensation. The value of the services provided by VSU is approximately PhP 32,000, and the services provided by the other groups is valued at approximately PhP 10,000 each, for a total of PhP 62,000 in donated time and expertise. 3 Peace Corps Volunteers also contributed by shouldering the cost of their transportation and expenses in order to help with this program.</span></p></blockquote>
